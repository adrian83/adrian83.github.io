      <description>Always, when I try to remove versioned object from S3 bucket, I wonder, why there is no possibility to do this from AWS console. If you, similary as I, wasted too much time to remove versioned objects from S3, you probably have prepared script for doing this. If not, you can use this simple Python script.
import boto3 import sys maxVersions = 30 versionsLabel = &amp;#34;Versions&amp;#34; versionIdLabel = &amp;#34;VersionId&amp;#34; nextVersionIdMarkerLabel = &amp;#34;NextVersionIdMarker&amp;#34; bucket = sys.</description>
