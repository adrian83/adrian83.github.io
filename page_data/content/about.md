I'm a software developer with expertise in Java, Python, and Go. My mainstay is Java, where I've crafted robust, scalable applications. I'm also well-versed in Python and Go, allowing me to adapt to various projects and challenges.

In recent years, I've immersed myself in AWS, earning the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification. This certifies my ability to design complex, efficient cloud solutions. I take pride in my ability to architect solutions that optimize resource usage, enhance performance, and ensure top-notch security.

I'm known for my team-oriented approach and am an easy-going collaborator. I'm a firm believer that great results come from open communication and teamwork when tackling complex problems.

I have a deep passion for continuous learning. Staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies drives me to excel in the ever-evolving tech world.
