EBS is a persisten block storage volumes which can be used (attached) by EC2. Volumes can be detached and attached between EC2 instances.

Volumes:

1. Magnetic HDD - throughput optimized  
2. General purpose SSD - IO (read / write) optimized, max iops per volume is 16 000  
3. Provisioned IOPS SSD - low latency, high throughput, max iops per volume is 64 000

Snapshot is a point in time backup (stored in s3) of the data from EBS volume. EBS volumes can be created from snapshots
