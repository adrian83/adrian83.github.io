### If for some reasons you don't want to run Tensorflow scripts locally you can easily do this inside of Docker container.

Curently Tensorflow can be run only on Python 3.4â€“3.7. Upgrading or downgrading python can lead to different types of problems. Fortunatelly we can run Tensorflow scripts on Docker containers.

<br/>

First we need to create file `test_installation.py` with content which will be used to test the installation:
```
import tensorflow as tf

tensor1 = tf.convert_to_tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype = tf.int32)
tensor2 = tf.convert_to_tensor([[2, 3], [4, 5]], dtype = tf.int32)

result = tf.add(tensor1, tensor2)

print(result)
```
<br/>

Before running this code please be aware that this will download Docker image with size around 2,5GB
```
$ docker system df -v
Images space usage:

REPOSITORY                TAG                   IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE                SHARED SIZE         UNIQUE SIZE         CONTAINERS
tensorflow/tensorflow     latest                9bf93bf90865        10 days ago         2.469GB             64.19MB             2.405GB      
```
<br/>

Now we can just run the script by executing this command:  
`docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/tmp -w /tmp tensorflow/tensorflow python ./test_installation.py`

<br/>

Let's look closer at the generic form of the command  
`$ docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]`

1. Options
    - `-it` - starts container in interactive mode (actually connection of `-i` and `-t`)
    - `-rm` - clean up the container and remove the file system
    - `-v` - mounts current directory to `/tmp` directory inside docker container
    - `-w` - setting working directory to `/tmp`
2. Image - latest version of Tensorflow - `tensorflow/tensorflow`
3. Command and arguments `python ./test_installation.py`

<br/>

As a result you should see some amount of logs and result of the executed script somewhere at the bottom of the output.
```
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/tmp -w /tmp tensorflow/tensorflow python ./test_installation.py
